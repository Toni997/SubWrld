178
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,499
That thing you play CDs on

179
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,502
when you're painting or
working in the yard or whatever.

180
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:26,846
My boom box.

181
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,713
That really what they're called?

182
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,475
They were. I believe now
they're called obsolete.

183
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,519
Uh, yeah, it's in the workshop.

184
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,095
It plays tapes, right?

185
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:36,897
It does, last I checked.

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
How were things at school today?

187
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:47,074
Same. Everyone's still acting weird.

188
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,535
And you?

189
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:51,537
Um...

190
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:54,915
How are you doing?

191
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,170
Me? I'm... fine.

192
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:00,880
I'm good.

193
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,803
So, can I... I can use the boom box?

194
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,297
Yes, of course. The boom box.

195
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:11,432
Go.

196
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,226
But... keep in touch.

197
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,644
Okay?

198
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:17,980
Sure thing, Dad.

199
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:36,999
<i>Hey, it's Hannah.</i>

200
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,834
<i>Hannah Baker.</i>

201
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:40,841
Holy shit.

202
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:44,840
<i>Don't adjust your... whatever
device you're hearing this on.</i>

203
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,720
<i>It's me, live and in stereo.</i>

204
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:54,299
No return engagements, no encore,

205
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,228
and this time, absolutely no requests.

206
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,147
Get a snack. Settle in.

207
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:03,692
Because I'm about to tell
you the story of my life.

208
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,613
More specifically, why my life ended.

209
00:13:08,648 --> 00:13:10,950
<i>And if you're listening to this tape...</i>

210
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,327
<i>you're one of the reasons why.</i>

211
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:17,456
<i>I'm not saying which tape
brings you into the story.</i>

212
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,575
<i>But fear not, if you received
this lovely little box,</i>

213
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,285
<i>your name will pop up.</i>

214
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:23,545
<i>I promise.</i>

215
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,258
<i>Anyway, the rules here
are pretty simple.</i>

216
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,125
<i>- There are only two.
- Whatcha doing?</i>

217
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:31,011
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

218
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,129
What have we said about
helicopter parenting?

219
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,464
I didn't mean to scare you.

220
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,259
You were just lost in... what
is that you're listening to?

221
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,938
It's, uh... it's nothing.
It's for history class.

222
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,264
- Cassettes are history now?
- Mm-hm.

223
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,724
Hm! Of course they are.

224
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:45,809
Can I listen?

225
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,644
No, uh, it's dumb.

226
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,947
I'm gonna head up to my room. Homework.

227
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:56,161
Clay, school emailed again today.

228
00:13:57,488 --> 00:14:00,073
Which explains why Dad
showed interest in my life.

229
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,992
You two are dangerous
when you coordinate.

230
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:03,618
You know I hate being the kind of parent

231
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:06,547
who asks if you want to
talk about anything, but...

232
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:08,591
if you want to talk about anything...

233
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,968
I didn't really know her, Mom.

234
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,762
Didn't you two work
together at the Crestmont?

235
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:18,142
- Yeah, for a little while...
- But you didn't know her very well?

236
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:19,810
Not really.

237
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:22,595
I need to get to work...

238
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,681
- Shit!
- Language.

239
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:27,767
I'm sorry. I gotta... I gotta go work.

240
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:30,529
This thing is due in
two days, so I gotta go.

241
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,031
Clay.

242
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,657
Slow down, hon.

243
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:35,659
It's just homework.

244
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,163
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

245
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,009
What the hell?

246
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:55,638
[grunts]

247
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,109
Shit.

248
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,111
[sighs]

249
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,706
I have to go to Tony's.

250
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:25,459
Hold on, Tony's? Now?

251
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:28,870
He needs one of the tapes.
We're working together.

252
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,413
Dinner's in a half hour.

253
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:32,383
Make me a plate for later?

254
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,469
Text me if you're gonna
be later than really late.

255
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,846
- I will. Bye.
- Bye.

256
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,573
[children chattering]

257
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,627
[horn honking]

258
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:23,684
Hand me the screwdriver.

259
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:26,353
Okay.

260
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,359
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, Clay.

261
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:35,186
- Something wrong with her?
- Nothing wrong yet.

262
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:37,197
It's called taking care of things.

263
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:41,869
- Dad, you remember Clay.
- Yeah, sure.

264
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,412
How you doing, Clay?

265
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,155
I'm well, thank you.

266
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:46,665
So, Clay, what's up?

267
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,741
Nothing. I was, uh...

268
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,160
I was out for a ride.

269
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:51,837
On the other side of town?

270
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,457
That should do it. Start her up.

271
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,718
- Hand me the rag.
- I'll do it.

272
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,809
If we got the timing
right, we'll hear it.

273
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,770
Okay, flip the ignition.

274
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,681
[engine turning over]

275
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,525
[engine revs]

276
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,396
You hear that? That's
how it should sound.

277
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:21,316
- That sounds different?
- Yeah, it's different. Are you deaf?

278
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,500
[Tony] Sounds the same as before.

279
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:23,961
Then you are deaf.

280
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:25,898
That's so much smoother.
Like night and day.

281
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:26,993
[Tony responds indistinctly]

282
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,365
[Tony's dad] I don't think
so. I know, and you should too.

283
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,242
That's why I'm showing you this.

284
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,586
Okay, shut her off.

285
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:34,963
[engine shuts off]

286
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,792
I should get out of here.

287
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,617
Sure you don't want to stay for dinner?

288
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:43,463
No, thanks. My mom's making pork chops.

289
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:46,424
If I'm not home soon, she'll
call the cops or something.

290
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,176
They emailed all the parents again.

291
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,562
- Oh, I know.
- [Tony's dad] She leave a note?

292
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,773
Girl who killed herself?

293
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:55,025
Uh...

294
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,610
I don't know.

295
00:17:57,436 --> 00:17:59,196
[speaks low in Spanish]

296
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,022
Well, you listen to me.

297
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,326
You ever do that to your mother,
I will kill you, you understand?

298
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,736
I'll kill you dead.

299
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,038
Clean this shit up.

300
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:12,659
No sense of irony in that comment.

301
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,160
None. He's, uh...

302
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,286
He's a simple man.

303
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:16,421
Yep.

304
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,456
I'll see you later.

305
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,759
Clay, I think you got
something that belongs to me.

306
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,179
I do?

307
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,432
My keys.

308
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,601
Oh, yeah, right. Here.

309
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:31,603
I'll see you later.

310
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,650
[Hannah] <i>The rules
here are pretty simple.</i>

311
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,035
<i>There are only two.</i>

312
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:50,080
<i>Rule number one: you listen.</i>

313
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:53,083
<i>Number two: you pass it on.</i>

314
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,077
<i>Hopefully, neither one will be easy.</i>

315
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:59,330
<i>It's not supposed to be easy, or
I would have emailed you an MP3.</i>

316
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:02,125
<i>When you're done
listening to all 13 sides,</i>

317
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:05,053
<i>because there are 13
sides to every story...</i>

318
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,672
<i>rewind the tapes, put
them back in the box,</i>

319
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:09,757
<i>and pass them on to the next person.</i>

320
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,476
Why the hell am I on this?

321
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,980
<i>Oh, and the box of tapes
should have included a map.</i>

322
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:18,901
<i>I'll be mentioning several
spots around our beloved city.</i>

323
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,768
<i>I can't force you to visit them,</i>

324
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,781
<i>but if you'd like a little more
insight, head for the stars.</i>

325
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:29,536
<i>Or, you know, just throw the
map away and I'll never know...</i>

326
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:31,955
<i>or will I?</i>

327
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,368
<i>You see, in case you're
tempted to break the rules,</i>

328
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:40,371
<i>understand I did make
a copy of these tapes,</i>

329
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:42,457
<i>and I left them with
a trusted individual</i>

330
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,543
<i>who, if this package doesn't
make it through all of you,</i>

331
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:48,263
<i>will release those copies
in a very public manner.</i>

332
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,257
This was not a spur
of the moment decision.

333
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,477
<i>Do not take me for granted.</i>

334
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:54,761
<i>Not again.</i>

335
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,063
I never did!

336
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:59,098

Yeah. No, I just forgot something.

What? It's nothing.

354
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:33,901
Low-hanging branch. I went
through the woods. It was dark.

355
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:35,194
I'll get the first aid kit.

356
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,113
I don't need first aid.

357
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,198
You are bleeding. You need ointment.

358
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,084
Mom, please don't say "ointment."

359
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,246
I'm fine, really.

360
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,999
- What happened?
- I told you, bike, branch, skin.

361
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,167
That's all?

362
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:50,960
Mom, I tell you everything about my life

363
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:53,045
because it is so fascinating, I promise.

364
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,214
I'll clean it up. I have
to go. Tony's waiting.

365
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:56,349
Ah-ah.

366
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,271
Your helmet, please.

367
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,288
[Hannah] Love the helmet.

368
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:20,540
It's adorable.

369
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:24,452
You mean "adorable" in a helpless
baby animal sort of way, I'm guessing.

370
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:26,287
Aren't you afraid of helmet hair?

371
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:29,216
My hair does the same thing no
matter what, just sits there.

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,542
You just need some product.

373
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,920
A little effort to style it,
blow-dry it in the morning.

374
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,963
And sacrifice my masculinity?

375
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:38,099
That ship has sailed, don't you think?

376
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:42,020
Forgive me for wanting to
keep my brains in my head.

377
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:45,398
Instead of, say, some other
regions, like most boys?

378
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:49,143
Come on, Helmet, you've
got bathrooms to clean.

379
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:51,947
- You mean "we've got."
- Mm. I don't, actually.

380
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:55,191
Oh, uh, party at my
house tomorrow night.

381
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,453
You're invited. It's mandatory.
Don't bring the helmet.

382
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,625
Cool. Where, uh... where do you live?

383
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:07,754
[Hannah] <i>Put your finger on "C,"</i>
<i>your other finger on "4."</i>

384
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:12,008
<i>Bring them together.
That's our first red star.</i>

385
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:13,862
<i>I know, right?</i>

386
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:16,796
<i>A map. Old school, again.</i>

387
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,214
<i>No Google Maps,</i>

388
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:22,936
<i>no app, no chance for the interwebs to
make everything worse, like it does.</i>

389
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:38,994
[engine revs]

390
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:09,399
[engine revs, tires squeal]

391
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:20,994
[Hannah] <i>You've arrived at my
first house in this shitty town...</i>

392
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:25,207
<i>where I threw my first and only party...</i>

393
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:28,668
<i>and where I met Justin Foley...</i>

394
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:31,037
<i>the subject of our first tape.</i>

395
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,673
[rock music plays indistinctly]

396
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,968
<i>It was just a party.</i>

397
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:40,671
<i>I didn't know it was the
beginning of the end.</i>

398
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:43,433
- [music continues]
- [overlapping chatter]

399
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:50,681
<i>Justin, you were in love with
my friend Kat. My only friend.</i>

400
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:52,767
He came! Clay's here!

401
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:55,478
- [chuckles]
- I win! You owe me five dollars.

402
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,655
Oh, my God.

403
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,314
- You bet on me?
- Against you.

404
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:03,036
Last party I saw Clay at...
mm, my birthday, fourth grade.

405
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:05,655
- I still remember that clown.
- Mm!

406
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,573
Oh, my God. He was a heroin addict.

407
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:11,786
My mother the social worker
hired a recovering heroin addict.

408
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:13,505
He had the shakes.

409
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:16,841
Okay, uh, drinks. Come on. Excuse me.

410
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,460
- I just thought he was nervous.
- [both chuckle]

411
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:20,762
- Hey.
- Hi, Kat.

412
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:24,340
This is quite a turnout.
People are happy to see you go.

413
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:27,635
I really just threw it so Hannah
could finally meet some people

414
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:29,929
before I depart this realm.

415
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,347
I met Helmet.

416
00:25:31,348 --> 00:25:33,265
Clay doesn't count. You met him at work.

417
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:36,143
- I feel like that should count.
- Of course you do.

418
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:39,563
Okay, refills. Clay, what is your drink?

419
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:40,815
Uh, Sprite.

420
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,733
Oh, my God, you are priceless.

421
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:45,245
You are a gem. You'll have a beer.

422
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:47,530
Sure, I like beer.

423
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:49,624
- [Tyler] Kat.
- Oh. Picture.

424
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,043
[shutter clicks]

425
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:57,549
Stop having so much fun, Clay.

426
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,718
I'm having fun, totally.

427
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:01,136
Woot!

428
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:05,056
You're too buttoned up.

429
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,269
[laughing]

430
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:12,522
Hey there.

431
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:14,107
Hey.

432
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:18,028
You're, um, you're the new girl.

433
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:19,645
Apparently.

434
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,814
Uh, I like your laugh.

435
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:22,982
Thanks.

436
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,702
I like your understated
sense of fashion.

437
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:28,195
[chuckles] Thanks.

438
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:29,372
[Kat] Bryce.

439
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:32,584
Better go hit the keg and
catch up. You're an hour behind.

440
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:36,245
I'll see you later... I hope.

441
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:37,630
See you.

442
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:42,793
Oh, God, no. Solid no, Hannah.

443
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:45,087
He is, like, frat boy Darth Vader.

444
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:46,681
He didn't seem that bad.

445
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:48,215
I was being kind.

446
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:49,768
She kind of was.

447
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,897
I think I want a beer too.

448
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,317
Okay, then, Princess Leia.

449
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,195
Oh, my God, you're both nerds.

450
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:01,821
Have fun.

451
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:08,537
Are you gonna tell her?

452
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,272
Tell her what?

453
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:13,458
Oh, please. I've known
you this entire century.

454
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:15,951
Well, give me a break.

455
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:17,504
I'm not good with the...

456
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:20,706
you know, and the gay rumors
only recently subsided.

457
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,426
Mmm. So the stakes are high for you.

458
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:27,463
It's like, around her, I
can be different, you know?

459
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:29,381
I'm the new and improved Clay Jensen:

460
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:33,103
high school sophomore,
archaeologist-slash-adventurer.

461
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:38,140
Clay, sweets, you're a prize.

462
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:43,738
But from my limited observation,
she has terrible taste in guys.

463
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:48,493
You won't say anything to her?

464
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:50,995
Only if it comes up.

465
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,622
Kat!

466
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:54,707
[cell phone vibrating]

467
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,092
[phone clicks]

468
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,356
- Shit!
- Watch it!

469
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:24,144
[laughing, yelling]

470
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:25,855
No...

471
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:27,022
[Kat] Meet the boys.

472
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:31,244
Justin Foley is mine,
and Zach Dempsey for you.

473
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,445
Zach Dempsey? Really?

474
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,415
What? Zach's sweet?

475
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,741
I can't see!

476
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:38,877
Not the mane!

477
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,871
Okay, yeah, he's kind of dumb,

478
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:45,091
but he's the sweet kind of
dumb, which is the best kind.

479
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:49,461
Yes.

480
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,882
Liberty High's star athletes,
ladies and gentlemen.

481
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:54,758
So impressive.

482
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:57,720
Sorry, boys. Can't have you
in Hannah's house soaking wet.

483
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,221
Seriously?

484
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:01,107
Oh, my God, look at yourselves.

485
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,559
Better?

486
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,605
Improvement, for sure, but
sorry, it's still a no-go.

487
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,106
Come on! It's not a party without us.

488
00:29:09,107 --> 00:29:10,357
[Kat] We'll take our chances.

489
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:11,734
Go dry off.

490
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:13,578
Your loss, milady.

491
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:15,988
Idiots. I can't even...

492
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:17,540
But they're sweet idiots.

493
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,749
[Hannah] <i>So, you see,</i>
<i>that's where the trouble began.</i>

494
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,384
<i>That smile.</i>

495
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:32,430
<i>That damned smile.</i>

496
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,479
<i>The one and only Kat moved away
before the start of school.</i>

497
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:44,099
<i>She was the kind of friend
that couldn't be replaced,</i>

498
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,320
<i>even by falling in love with
the boy she left behind.</i>

499
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,114
[Justin] Hey.

500
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:54,276
- Hannah, right?
- Right.

501
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:56,362
Justin. Foley.

502
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,530
I saw you at the party the other night.

503
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:00,458
Yeah, I saw you too.

504
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,961
You're drier now.

505
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,713
Yeah, well, we went home and changed.

506
00:30:06,248 --> 00:30:07,549
Was it profound?

507
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,147
Huh?

508
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,306
Your change.

509
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:13,541
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.

510
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:16,257
So, uh...

511
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:17,466
Kat's gone.

512
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,977
Yeah. Sucks.

513
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:22,930
You talk to her?

514
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:26,183
Yeah. I mean, you know, like, a little.

515
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,318
Yeah, me too.

516
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,696
A little.

517
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:35,192
I, uh, should get to class.

518
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:37,695
Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally. [chuckles]

519
00:30:37,696 --> 00:30:39,789
So, I'll see you around, then.

520
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:41,791
I guess you will.

521
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:47,288
<i>Being Kat's boyfriend was kind of
the only remarkable thing about you,</i>

522
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:50,341
<i>but, Justin, you were my Kryptonite.</i>

523
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,801
<i>Zach who?</i>

524
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,261
[Hannah] Dempsey.

525
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,920
<i>Oh!</i>

526
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,005
<i>Sorry, love.</i>

527
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:58,132
<i>I'm learning all these new boy names,</i>

528
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,760
<i>and I've dragged most of the old

How do you know?

I can't tell you that.
You have to listen.
